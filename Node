# 1. Use an official Node.js runtime as a parent image
# 'alpine' is a lightweight Linux distribution to keep the image size small
FROM node:20-alpine

# 2. Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# 3. Copy package.json and package-lock.json first
# This allows Docker to cache your dependencies if these files haven't changed
COPY package*.json ./

# 4. Install dependencies
# 'npm ci' is preferred for automated environments as it's faster and more reliable
RUN npm ci --only=production

# 5. Copy the rest of your application code
COPY . .

# 6. Expose the port your app runs on
EXPOSE 3000

# 7. Define the command to run your app
CMD ["node", "index.js"]
